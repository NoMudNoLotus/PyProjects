# PyProjects
Python scripts as listed by user Karan (https://github.com/karan/Projects)
completed by NoMudNoLotus
This project will be continuously updated as I finish more of the projects
on the list. 

# PyScripts
Banners.py, portscanner.py, and PyScripts.py are each part of the PyScripts.py
script. PyScripts.py is simply the wrapper.

# weather-checker.py
This script is, as the name states, a weather checker that takes one argument: 
city name. The script utilizes the openweathermap api, and requires you enter
in your api key to work.

# file-integrity-checker.py
This script checks the integrity of files in a directory by using the hashlibs 
library md5 module. It breaks the file into chunks for both speed and to 
minimize errors, then it compares the hex digests previously stored and
alerts the user if any changes are detected.
